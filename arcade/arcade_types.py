# This is a temporary workaround for the lack of a way to type annotate
# objects implementing the buffer protocol. Although there is a PEP to
# add typing, it is scheduled for 3.12. Since that is years away from
# being our minimum Python version, we have to use a workaround. See
# the PEP and Python doc for more information:
# https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/
